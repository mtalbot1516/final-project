## Question we are trying to answer

Looking at specific neighborhoods within the Nashville housing market, we are using supervised machine learning models to see if we can find houses that are below market value by using a machine learning model. We will train the model on a number of features like square feet, bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, appliances, renovation date, to predict price. The goal would be to find good houses to invest in.

## Source Data

The source data will come from various real estate websites that provide relevant information regarding housing sales, prices, and feature. We will query the RealEstate APis from websites like ZillowGroup API, The Realty Mole API, and MLS
